# Factory Design Pattern

- Create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.
- Wholesale object creation (non-piecewise, unlike builder) can be outsourced to
  - A separate function (Factory method)
  - That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
