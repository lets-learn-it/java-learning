# Prototype Design Pattern

- Cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement

## Advantages

- reduces need of subclassing
- hides complexities of creating objects
- clients can get new objects without knowing which type of object it will be.
- lets you add or remove objects at runtime.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
