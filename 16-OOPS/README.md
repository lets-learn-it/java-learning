# OOPS

## 4 pillars of OOPS

1. **Abstraction**:

- hiding implementation details and showing only functionality to user.
- can be achieved by _abstract classess_ & _interfaces_.

2. **Encapsulation**:

- process of binding data and methods within class. declare data members as private & restrict direct access to data while providing public methods (getters & setters)
- Within setters implement data validation for ensuring data integrity

3. **Inheritance**:

- defining parent-child relationship between classes, by doing so, you can reuse the code that is already defined in the parent class.
- code reusability is the biggest advantage of inheritance.

4. **Polymorphism**:

- object or function can takes different forms.
- Type of polymorphism
  - _Compile time polymorphism (Method overloading)_ : Two or more methods in one class have same method name but different arguments.
  - _Run time polymorphism (Method overriding)_ : Two methods with same name and parameters in parent and child class
